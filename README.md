#Galactooligosaccharide modulates the juvenile microbiome to improve broiler chicken performance

We found that at 35 day old (standard industry slaughter age) chickens on a galactooligosaccharide-supplemented diet had a greater growth rate and improved feed conversion relative to chickens on calorie-matched control diet. Increased levels of *Lactobacillus johnsonii* at the expense of *Lactobacillus crispatus* was linked to performance and is complemented by an intestinal immune response in the host involving an increase in IL-17 decrease in IL-10 genes expression. The immune response to shifts in key *Lactobacillus* spp. may support or prime intestinal homeostasis by producing cytokines with potential cross-reactivity to pathogens.
